    "Last week we looked at several approaches for controllling False Positive Rate (FPR), Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) and False Discovery Rate (FDR). However, they all have some drawbacks for medical decision making: FPR and FWER do not depend on the prevalence of the disease and neither of them allows a decision maker to consider different misclassification costs arising from false-negative and false-positive diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making medical decisions, wrong diagnoses carry different costs. Deciding that a patient does not have the virus when in reality they do is a **False Negative**. The potential consequences of such decision are severe: lack of treatment, risk of infecting others, and even premature death.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, deciding that a patient has the virus when in reality they don't is a **False Positive**. The potential consequences of that include distress, unnecesary treatment and costs of subsequent testing. This is certainly not ideal, but less severe than the consequences of a false negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've previously evaluated decisions in terms of their TPR and FPR, and showed how ROC curves demonstrate the trade-off curve between the two quantities. We saw that it is not always clear how to choose the best trade-off.\n",

    "A very popular way of choosing the trade-off, and simultaneously comparing different procedures, is the idea of **risk** that we learnt in Lecture 5. Here, the analyst constructs a loss function by specifying the **cost** of making each type of mistake.\n"
