    "### Online decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "We return to the setting of *sequential, adaptive decision-making under uncertainty*, a topic we have already talked about in the context of false discovery rate control. There, the objective is to keep the FDR below some threshold, and the hypotheses considered are not necessarily related to each other. In this unit, however, we will consider the situation where we have to make the **same** (or similar) decision repeatedly, and where we want to **learn** from the consequenes of our earlier decisions, and thereby **improve** our subsequent decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a paradigm that captures a large number of problems arising in scientific, business, and industrial settings. In fact, it is woven into our everyday lives. Recall the last time you tried to learn a new skill via trial and error. For the sake of concreteness, suppose you were learning how to play chess. Over the course of many games, you would learn which moves or strings of moves are more successful, which are less successful, and then adapt your gameplay to incorporate more of the successful moves. Alternatively, imagine moving to a new city and having to figure out which restaurants you like. You would probably try out a few different restaurants, and keep going back to the ones whose food you enjoyed on previous visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration vs exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "When making decisions under uncertainty, we are faced with two competing urges. On the one hand, we want to make the best choice given current knowledge (exploitation), and yet on the other hand, we want to make diverse choices in order to acquire more information with which we can improve future decisions (exploration). Balancing exploration and exploitation is a fundamental problem. Once we hit upon a promising choice (a chess strategy that seems to have a high win percentage, or a restaurant you enjoy), then it is tempting to settle down and keep making the same choice over and over again. However, doing so is to ignore the possibility that a different strategy could be more powerful, or that the new restaurant on Telegraph could be closer to your heart's desire. Conversely, if we keep trying out new options, with each new option we run the risk of it being terrible (or just bang average), and us having to pay the consequent price."

    "### What's a bandit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A (multi-armed) bandit problem is a particular setting for online decision-making characterized by the following: we receive an *immediate* payoff, or **reward**, for every decision, and the payoff for each decision being completely *independent of previous decisions*. This is a pretty reasonable model for the restaurant example. We get pleasure immediately after having each meal, and it seems relatively reasonable to assume that our enjoyment of a meal is independent of the past meals that we have had. In chess, if we treat each move as a decision, then this is not such a valid assumption. We do not receive an immediate payoff from each move, but only at the end of a game, if we win. Furthermore, how much a move contributes to the probability of an eventual win depends on the state of the game, and hence on the previous moves. Chess is hence more accurately described by the paradigm of reinforcement learning, which is the topic of a future lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slightly more formally, we consider a decision-maker, or learner, who is given $K$ options to choose from. We refer to these options as *arms*. Associated with each arm is a probability distribution over rewards. Initially, this distribution is unknown to the decision-maker. The decision-maker chooses an arm, usually referred to as *pulling* an arm, and receives a reward sampled from the corresponding reward distribution. This process is repeated over and over again. A key element here is the *stochastic* nature of the reward. If we have a bad experience at a restaurant, it could be that the food is bad, or alternatively, it could just be bad luck: We may have ordered the wrong dish, or the kitchen could be having a bad day, or perhaps we were in a foul mood for other reasons. Perhaps we should then give the restaurant a few more chances before crossing it off our list."

    "The goal is to maximize the sum of rewards over all time steps. Sometimes future rewards are discounted, when rewards in the future are viewed as less valuable than more immediate rewards. A typical way to measure the quality of realized decisions is via **regret**, which is the difference between our total, realized reward, and the reward of some kind of oracle who knows more than we do. Usually, this is an oracle who knows in advance which is the optimal arm. Regret is thus a direct quantification of the opportunity cost we incur from making sub-optimal decisions.\n",

    "### Bandit history\n",
    "\n",
    "For an interesting account of the origin of this problem, we quote from the excellent textbook *Bandit Algorithms* by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari.\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>Bandit problems were introduced by William R. Thompson in an article published in 1933 in Biometrika. Thompson was interested in medical trials and the cruelty of running a trial blindly, without adapting the treatment allocations on the fly as the drug appears more or less effective.</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>The name comes from the 1950s, when Frederick Mosteller and Robert Bush decided to study animal learning and ran trials on mice and then on humans. The mice faced the dilemma of choosing to go left or right after starting in the bottom of a T-shaped maze, not knowing each time at which end they would find food. To study a similar learning setting in humans, a ‘two-armed bandit’ machine was commissioned where\n",
    "humans could choose to pull either the left or the right arm of the machine, each giving a random pay-off with the distribution of pay-offs for each arm unknown to the human player. The machine was called a ‘two-armed bandit’ in homage to the one-armed bandit, an old-fashioned name for a lever-operated slot machine (‘bandit’ because they steal your money).</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandit algorithms have found numerous applications. They are used in healthcare (personalization of mobile healthcare apps, Warfarin dosage), finance (portfolio selection), pricing, telecommunications, and also as subroutines of algorithms for solving other machine learning problems, such as hyperparameter optimization and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond practical applications, bandit problems are also fundamental to theoretical machine learning because they capture the exploration-exploitation tradeoff problem in its most elemental state."

    "Let $\\mathcal{A}$ denote a set of $K$ arms. We will denote the **reward distribution** for arms $a\\in\\mathcal{A}$ by $P_a$. We will assume that the distributions are [$1$-sub-Gaussian](http://data102.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-sync?repo=https://github.com/ds-102/sp21&subPath=lecture/lecture17/concentration.ipynb). This is called the **environment**. The learner and the environment interact sequentially over $n$ rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each round $t \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, the learner selects an arm $A_t$. The environment then samples a reward $X_t$ from the distribution $P_{A_t}$, and reveals $X_t$ to the learner. This interaction induces a joint distribution over the sequence of actions and outcomes $A_1,X_1,A_2,X_2,\\ldots,A_n,X_n$. There are two implications of this set up:\n",
    "1. $X_t$ is conditionally independent of $A_1,X_1,A_2,X_2,\\ldots,X_{t-1}$ given $A_t$.\n",
    "2. The learner's selection of $A_t$ is allowed to be probabililistic, i.e. a distribution $\\pi_t$ over $\\mathcal{A}$, but $\\pi_t$ can only depend on the past ($A_1,X_1,A_2,X_2,\\ldots,X_{t-1}$) and not the future ($X_t$,$A_{t+1},\\ldots,A_n,X_n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of rules that the learner uses to make decisions is called a **policy**, and is often denoted with a symbol $\\pi$. Mathematically, $\\pi$ is a sequence of transition kernels $\\{\\pi_t\\}_{t=1}^n$ (conditional densities of the form $\\pi_t(a_t|a_1,x_1,\\ldots,a_{t-1},x_{t-1})$). Don't worry if this sounds confusing. You don't have to understand this formalism in order to understand the rest of the unit.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Notation:** Before stating the algorithm, we need to change the notation. Because we are being Bayesian, we need to be even more careful about what we are conditioning on. Hence, we assume an $n\\times K$ matrix $X$ of *potential* rewards, where all entries are independent, and $X_{ij} \\sim P_j$ for each $i$ and $j$ (i.e. the entries in column $j$ are drawn from the reward distribution for arm $j$.) Finally, note that we recover the old model by setting the observered reward at time $t$, $X_t$, to be equal to $X_{T_{A_t}(t),A_t}$ under this new notation. In other words if arm $a$ is pulled at step $t$, then the reward revealed is the earliest entry in the $a$-th column that has yet to be revealed thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up Thompson Sampling, we will need a prior $\\pi_a$ for the mean of each arm, as well as a likelihood for the rewards. It is typical to use a Beta-Bernoulli or Normal-Normal conjugate pair. Note that the model *does not has to be the same as the true reward distribution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, at each round $t$, we consider the posterior distribution over $\\mu_a$, for each arm $a \\in \\{ 1,...,K\\}$,  given all the samples you have observed from that arm $X_{1,a},...,X_{T_a(t-1),a}$:\n",
    "$$P_{a,t}=\\mathbb{P}(\\mu_a | X_{1,a},...,X_{T_a(t-1),a}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can now be written as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thompson sampling algorithm**: At each round $t$\n",
    "1. Draw a posterior sample for each arm: $\\mu_{a,t} \\sim  P_{a,t}$ for $a \\in \\{1,...,K\\}$.\n",

    "$ A_t=\\underset{1 \\leq a \\leq K}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\mu_{a,t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the probability we assign to choosing arm $a$ is the probability that it is the largest arm under the posterior on all of the data.\n",

In the limit of infinite samples, the effect of the prior gets washed out by the likelihood, and posterior distributions start to mostly resemble frequentist confidence intervals. As such, the algorithm should behave very similarly to UCB in this regime."

    "First, notice that the performance of all the methods does seem to be logarithmic in time, as suggested by the theory. Second, the performance of TS varies greatly depending on the choice of prior. With a good prior, it performs better than UCB, but with a bad prior, it performs worse. On the other hand, when the prior is the same for all the arms, and hence does not add any information about their ordering, TS still seems to perform better than UCB.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last observation agrees with our comparison of the regret bounds in Theorem 3 and in Theorem 2. We see that the TS regret bound is smaller. This leads us to ask the question: Is TS just universally better than UCB, or frequentist methods in general?\n",

    "The answer to that is a little subtle. We actually stated a *simple* version of UCB which is simple to state and simple to analyze. There are more sophisticated versions of UCB that do not require knowing the time horizon, and whose regret is even smaller than that of TS. Furthermore, we were somewhat kind in the simulation, and used a Gaussian likelihood that was exactly the same as the reward distributions (apart from not knowing the mean)."

    "In this unit so far, we have discussed a type of bandit problem called stochastic multi-armed bandits. In the literature, there are actually many more types of bandit problems, which we briefly discuss in this section. The material in this section will not be tested in homework or on the midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adversarial bandits:** Instead of assuming that the rewards are stochastic, i.e. drawn from some distribution, we assume that they are adversarial. This means that we allow the rewards to be completely arbitrary. This type of bandit problem has deep connections to game theory, and is perhaps more reflective of situations where there is competition between agents, though this is subject to [debate](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/adversarial_bandit_is_not_statistics_problem.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual bandits:** In some situations, the learner has access to side information in each round that is correlated with the rewards for different arms *for that round*, and can hence be used to inform the choice of action. This information, usually denoted $C_t$, is known as the *context*. For instance, in the restaurant example, if we are craving fried chicken at a given moment, then we are more likely to be fulfilled if we have fried chicken, as opposed to some other meal. Mathematically, the reward in round $t$ is given by $X_t = r(C_t,A_t) + \\eta_t$, where $r$ is a reward function, and $\\eta_t$ is mean zero noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear bandits:** Instead of having actions be a choice of arm, the action here is a choice of a vector $A_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. The reward is generated according to $X_t = A_t^T\\theta^* + \\eta_t$ for some fixed vector $\\theta^*$. This is also sometimes called online linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-stationary bandits:** Here, we assume that the arm reward distributions $P_a$ can change over time. This is a better model for dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured bandits:** To see an example of structured bandits, consider the following example of path planning.\n",

    "<img src=\"path_planning.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to get from the leftmost point to the rightmost point, with minimum loss incurred. Each segment of the path, which corresponds to an edge in the above graph, corresponds to some loss $\\ell_i$. If we don't know the values of $\\ell_i$ a priori, we could model this as a bandit problem, in which case we want to try out different paths and minimize the loss incurred by taking a path. In this case, arms correspond to different paths. If we get to see the losses as we go along, after crossing each edge, then we model this as a semi-bandit problem. In this case, we can associate losses with each segment of the road, which allows for more efficient learning, because in the full bandit setting we only observe the total loss once we take a whole path. Finally, we could also have full information available before having to explore different paths. In that case, we model the path planning problem as a standard supervised optimization problem, where we want to find the path minimizes the overall loss along that path."

    "## 10. Conclusion: The importance of model checking\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in this unit that the topic of bandit problems is both mathematically rich, and also has many practical applications. Going along with the theme of this course, whenever we wish to apply bandit algorithms such as UCB, it is important to ask whether the environment we are assuming is actually a good model of reality. For instance, while we have viewed the restaurant example as a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, there are some issues with doing so.\n",
    "1. The quality of the restaurant is not static, but evolves with changes in the kitchen staff or the management.\n",
    "2. As mentioned in the previous section, we have access to context. This includes our own fleeting cravings and spur-of-the-moment feelings, and also our current location in the city, who we are eating with, etc.\n",
    "3. Our preference for different restaurants are not independent, but are highly correlated. If we try a dim sum restaurant and enjoy it, then we probably will also enjoy other dim sum restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to *expand* our bandit environment model to account for issues 1 and 2. When doing this, however, we have to account for the bias-variance tradeoff: A larger model means that there is more to learn, and we might require many more samples before we converge on the optimal policy. The 3rd issue here actually *helps* us, because it gives structure to an otherwise impossibly large action space. By some accounts, there are about 7000 restaurants in the Bay Area, and we will probably never come close to trying all of them. However, I don't need to try all of the hot pot restaurants before concluding that I don't like hot pot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This discussion gives further evidence that the interplay between models, assumptions, bias and variance is a central theme of data science, and makes it as much art as science."
