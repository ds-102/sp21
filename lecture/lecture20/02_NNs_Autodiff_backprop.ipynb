Let's try to write these partial derivatives on the graph, and see if we can use them to keep working backwards.\n",

So, we'll take advantage of the chain rule and multiply by the \"derivative so far\": that's just $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q}$ = 16. So, our answer is $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a} = 1 \\cdot 16 = 16$.\n",

We multiply that with what we have so far, 16, to get 48.\n",
